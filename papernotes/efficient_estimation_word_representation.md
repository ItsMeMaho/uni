# Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space

Goal: produce word-vectors from huge datasets that capture semantic (and syntactic) similarity

## Notes

* computational complexity is given for all models

    - Feedforward Neural Net Language Model (NNLM)

    - Recurrent Neural Net Language Model
